### Hi there, I'm Warda 👋

I'm a Bachelor's student at **Murdoch University Dubai**, based in Dubai, UAE. I'm pursuing a double major in **Computer Science** and **Artificial Intelligence & Autonomous Systems** with a passion for building intelligent solutions.

- 🔭 I’m currently building projects in object detection (using YOLOv8), sentiment analysis (using BERTopic), and full-stack web development.
- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into advanced AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source AI projects.
