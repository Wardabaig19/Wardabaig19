I'm a computer science student based in Dubai, UAE, with a passion for Machine Learning and Data Science.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects related to university coursework (CT306) and personal ML experiments.
- 🌱 I’m exploring advanced topics in Explainable AI (XAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), like the work in my [MachineLearningModel](https://github.com/wadiqabaig/MachineLearningModel) repository.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source data science projects.
